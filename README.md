# Learning Go with Advent of Code 2022

I've been meaning to learn [Go](https://go.dev) for quite some time, but never quite fell into a good studying/practicing routine. The 2022 Advent of Code seems to have come at the perfect time to serve this purpose.

I have structured each day as an independent Go module, each with an identifier in the form `golang.bdn.sh/aoc-2022-$DAY`. This layout may change as I learn more about properly structuring Go projects.

As of day 1, I've completed reading [the official Go "Getting started" tutorials](https://go.dev/doc/) up through "[Tutorial: Getting started with multi-module workspaces](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/workspaces.html)", as well as skimming through [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com). The "Resources" section below will be kept updated as the days progress.
